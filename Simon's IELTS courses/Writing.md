    > Some people think that it is more effective for students to study in groups, while others believe that it is better for them to study alone. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. 
    
    |Plan| | |
    | ------ |---- | ------------------------------------------------- |
    |First sentence| Topic  | study in groups or alone                          |
    |Second sentence| Answer | sometimes better alone, usually better in a group |
    
    > **Paragraph 1**
    >
    > People have different views about the effectiveness of group study as opposed to working alone. While there are some benefits to studying independently, I believe that group work is usually more productive. 
    
  - Opinion

    > Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

    | Plan            |                           |                                                              |
    | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | First sentence  | Topic (just paraphrasing) | community service for all teenagers                          |
    | Second sentence | Answer                    | 3 choices: agree, disagree, or balanced opinion (when possible) |

    > **Paragraph 1**
    >
    > It is sometimes argued that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities.
    >
    > (I completely agree that this kind of scheme would be a good idea. )
    >
    > (In my opinion, it would be wrong to force teenagers to do any kind of unsalaried work. )
  >
    > (While I disagree with the idea of making such programmes compulsory, I do believe that voluntary community service could benefit young people. )

  - Problem and solution

    > Many criminals reoffend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem? 
  
    | Plan            |        |                                                              |
    | --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | First sentence  | Topic  | criminals reoffend                                           |
    | Second sentence | Answer | several reasons, a variety of measures (governments, communities) |

    > **Paragraph 1**
  >
    > It is true that punishments do not always deter criminals from committing more crimes. There are various reasons why offenders repeatedly break the law, but governments could certainly take steps to address this issue. 

  - Two-part question
  
    > As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers? 
  
  | Plan            |        |                                         |
  | --------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
  | First sentence  | Topic  | job satisfaction                        |
  | Second sentence | Answer | several factors, unrealistic/impossible |
  
    > **Paragraph 1**
    >
    > Work plays a central role in our lives, and we would all like to feel fulilled professionally. While a variety of factors may lead to job satisfaction, it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy at work. 
  
  *Focus on good vocabulary. You don't need to use best vocabulary or introductions to writing Task2, because you scores really comes from the main body paragraphs.*

- Summary
  - A short introduction is better
  - 2 sentences in 5 minutes (topics + answer)

### Main body paragraphs

- 2 main body paragraphs
- 5 sentences in each
- 90 to 100 words each
- 2 methods to write (**Firstly, Secondly, Finally** & **Idea, Explain, Example**)
- Good ideas, vocabulary and planning

#### Firstly, Secondly, Finally

- perfect for advantages, disadvantages, problems, solutions
- Any type of questions where we have more than one idea or we need to give more than one idea

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

> 3-minute plan:
>
> - disagree for several reasons
>
>   There are several reasons why I would argue against having compulsory community service for secondary school students. 
>
> - school timetable is full, no time for community service
>
>   **Firstly**, the school curriculum is already full with important academic subjects, such as maths, science and languages. 
>
>   **For example**, I remember having an extremely busy timetable when I was at high school, and it would not have been possible to add to it. 
>
> - students' work in other subjects would be affected
>
>   **Secondly**, students' performance in other subjects would be affected if valuable study time were taken by charity work or neighbourhood improvement schemes. 
>
> - teenagers might not want to do it (reluctant, no motivation)
>
>   Finally, I believe that teenage students would be reluctant to take part in any programme of obligatory work, and this could lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviour. 

Quickly summarize what we did:

- Try to write 5 sentences

  1. Topic sentence
  2. Firstly (5. explain more, or add example)
  3. Secondly
  4. Finally

- Remember:

  1. Linking words do **not** help your 'vocabulary' score

     'Firstly, Secondly, Finally...' is not considered as 'vocabulary'. It's just linking. You don't need to link in a complex way that will not help your score. Linking just need to be clear and do the job of making your ideas easy to follow.

  2. Examiners want to see 'topic vocabulary'

     The differences between linking words and topic vocabulary: 

     > There are several reasons why I would argue against having <font color='red'>compulsory community service</font> for secondary school students. <font color='green'>Firstly</font>, the <font color='red'>school curriculum</font> is already full with important <font color='red'>academic subjects</font>, such as maths, science and languages. <font color='green'>For example</font>, I remember having an <font color='red'>extremely busy timetable</font> when I was at high school, and it would not have been possible to add to it. <font color='green'>Secondly</font>, <font color='red'>students' performance</font> in other subjects would be affected if <font color='red'>valuable study time</font> were taken by <font color='red'>charity work or neighbourhood improvement schemes</font>. <font color='green'>Finally</font>, I believe that teenage students would be <font color='red'>reluctant</font> to take part in any programme of <font color='red'>obligatory work</font>, and this could lead to <font color='red'>poor motivation</font> and even bad behaviour. 
     >
     > (<font color='green'>Green</font> is linking words, <font color='red'>Red</font> is topic vocabulary)

#### Idea, Explain, Example

- If we only have one idea for that paragraph, we have to explain more detail
- one idea, a reason, an opinion

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a <font color='red'>compulsory</font> (<font color='green'>voluntary</font> could be good for students) part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

3-minute plan:

- voluntary (not compulsory) community service is positive

  On the other hand, the opportunity to do voluntary community service could be extremely positive for high school students. 

- students more motivated if they can choose

  By making these programmes optional, schools would ensure that only motivated students took part. 

- gain work experience, self confidence, skills

  These young people would gain valuable experience in an adult working environment, which could help to build their self confidence and enhance their skills. 

- good for CVs, career, university admissions, employers

  Having such experience and skills on their CVs could greatly improve school leavers' career prospects. <font color='green'>For example</font>, a period of voluntary work experience might impress a university admissions officer or a future employer.

Try to write 5 sentences

- Idea
- Explain (2 or 3 sentences)
- Example

**Remember**

- Linking words do not help your 'vocabulary' score
- Examiners want to see topic vocabulary' 

> <font color='green'>On the other hand</font>, the <font color='red'>opportunity</font> to do <font color='red'>voluntary community service</font> could be extremely positive for high school students.

#### Summary

**Main body paragraphs are the most important part**. You need **plan** them well before you start writing. You are going to write about hundred words for each of the two main body paragraphs, and that usually around 5 sentences. Good ideas, good vocabularies and they are going to be well structured if you follow the two easy methods mentioned above.

### Conclusion

**2 easy 'rules'**

- never write anything new
  - the conclusion should simply, repeat, or summarize what you have already said. Never put any new information there
- one sentence is enough
  - repeat, summarize

**Technique**

Paraphrase the answer that you gave in your information

Example of how to paragraph in a different way of four types

#### Discussion (+ opinion)

> **Question**
>
> In many cities the use of video cameras in public places is being increased in order to reduce crime, but some people believe that these measures restrict our individual freedom. 
>
> Do the benefits of increased security outweigh the drawbacks? 

> **Introduction**
>
> It is true that video surveillance has become commonplace in many cities in recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, I believe that there are more benefits than drawbacks. 

> **Conclusion**
>
> <font color='red'>In conclusion</font>, I would argue that the advantages of using video security systems in public places do outweigh the disadvantages. 

- First things to notice is I always start with ```In conclusion```. There is no reason to start in any other way. It will not improve your score if you find another phrase to begin with.

- Secondly,

  | Paraphrasing                 |                                     |
  | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
  | I believe                    | I would argue                       |
  | video surveillance           | video security systems              |
  | more benefits than drawbacks | advantages, outweigh, disadvantages |

- It's just one short simple sentence for the conclusion that paraphrases what I have already said. There is no new information in there. It just repeating, summarizing in a different way.

#### Opinion

> **Question**
>
> Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system.
>
> To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? 

> **Introduction**
>
> Some people believe that parents of children who attend private schools should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes. Personally, I completely disagree with this view. 

> **Conclusion**
>
> In conclusion, I do not believe that any financial concessions should be made for people who choose private education. 

| Paraphrasing                                   |                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| I completely disagree                          | I do not believe                    |
| should not need to contribute though taxes     | financial concessions               |
| parents of children who attend private schools | people who choose private education |

#### Problem and solution

> **Question**
>
> In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing.
>
> What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.

> **Introduction**
>
> It is true that people in industrialized nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems. 

> **Conclusion**
>
> In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older. 

| Paraphrasing                                               |                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| people in industrialized nations can expect to live longer | populations of countries grow older     |

#### Two-part question

> **Question**
>
> There are many different types of music in the world today.
>
> Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?

> **Introduction**
>
> It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.

> **Conclusion**
>
> In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and | believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music. 

| Paraphrasing                       |                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| a vital part of all human cultures | a necessary part of human existence |
| I would argue                      | I believe                           |
| is more important                  | should be given more importance     |

#### Summary

- One sentence
- No new information
- Paraphrasing to show variety

### Planning

**Spend 10 minutes planning your essay**

#### 3 step essay plan

> Some people think that it is <font color='red'>more effective</font> for students <font color='red'>to study in groups</font>, while others believe that it is better for them to <font color='red'>study alone</font>.
>
> <font color='red'>Discuss both views</font> and <font color='green'>give your own opinion</font>.

1. Read and understand the question
   
- highlight / underline key parts
  
2. Plan your essay structure (4 paragraphs)

   1. Introduction: **topic** + **answer**

      | topic (1 sentence)       | answer (1 sentence)                               |
      | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
      | study in groups or alone | sometimes better alone, usually better in a group |

   2. Benefits of studying alone

   3. Benefits of group alone (my view)

   4. Conclusion: repeat answer

      | repeat answer (1 sentence)             |
      | -------------------------------------- |
      | both have benefits, but I prefer group |

   **(4 minutes to complete step1-2)**

3. Plan ideas for the two main paragraphs (6 minutes)

   - brainstorm, note down any ideas you have
   - develop ideas in detail
   - keep asking yourself 'why'?
   - think of examples to support your ideas
   - finally, try to group related ideas (number them)

   | <font color='red'>$^1$</font>Benefits of studying alone (3 minutes) | <font color='red'>$^1$</font>Benefits of group study (3 minutes) |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | <font color='red'>$^2$</font>concentrate better $\stackrel{why?}{\longrightarrow}$ no distractions, focus on the task, <font color='red'>$^3$</font>read books or articles, <font color='red'>$^5$</font>study at own pace, <font color='red'>$^3$</font>e.g. when revising for exam, <font color='red'>$^4$</font>memorize information | <font color='red'>$^2$</font>more ideas $\stackrel{why?}{\longrightarrow}$ share knowledge,gather more information e.g. <font color='red'>$^3$</font>research project, <font color='red'>$^2$</font>learn from each other, <font color='red'>$^4$</font>more motivating, responsibility to the group, sense of competition |

   (<font color='red'>$^*$</font>means the number of those ideas in each paragraph to organize them when actually writing the paragraph)

#### Summary (10-minute essay plan, 3 steps)

1. Read and understand the question

2. Plan your essay structure

3. Plan ideas for the 2 main paragraphs

   **<FONT COLOR='RED'>Practice, Practice, Practice !!!</FONT>**

## Topic

### Opinion essay

> Do YOU agree or disagree?

**the key word is YOU. It's asking for your opinion, NOT the opinion of other people.**

> ~~Some people think this, other people think that. They only give their opinion at the end.~~
>
> (**It's a bed way to doing it**)

your opinion need to be clear from beginning introduction throughout the essay and repeat again in the conclusion, It's about you and your review NOT other people.

It's definitely acceptable to use the word "I" or "my".

You have to answer the question by saying what you think.

#### Example

> The <font color='red'>money spent by governments</font> on <font color='green'>space programmes</font> would be better spent on vital <font color='green'>public services</font> such as schools and hospitals.
>
> To what extent do <font color='red'>youÂ agree or disagree</font>? 

**Preparation**

1. Read and understand the question
   - highlight / underline key parts  (**YOU**)

2. Plan your essay structure (4 paragraphs)

   1. Introduction: (topic + answer)

      | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
      | government spending | agree - public services instead of space projects |

   2.  explain why 'space' spending should be stopped
   3.  explain why public service spending is better
   4. Conclusion: spend on services that benefit us all

3. Plan ideas for the two main paragraphs (6 minutes)

   | <font color='red'>$^1$</font>Why space spending should be stopped | <font color='red'>$^1$</font>Why public service spending is better |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | waste of money when projects fail, <font color='red'>$^2$</font>expensive (scientists, facilities, equipment), <font color='red'>$^3$</font>no benefit to normal people, politicians showing power, risk of <font color='red'>$^4$</font>accidents, deaths e.g. <font color='red'>$^5$</font>Challenger space shuttle | <font color='red'>$^2$</font>cheaper e.g. doctors, teachers police instead of astronauts, <font color='red'>$^3$</font>public services impact on everyone, <font color='red'>$^5$</font>reduce poverty, better quality of life, <font color='red'>$^4$</font>we all use schools, hospitals, police, roads etc. |
