- speak for 2 minutes

| 6 main topic areas |                |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Describe a         | person         |
|                    | place          |

|                    | your favorites |

**What we need to do in Part 2**

- <font color='red'>Work on good ideas and vocabulary for most common topic areas...</font>
- <font color='red'>NOT grammar or linking, It's all about good ideas and good vocabulary.</font>

<font color='red'>Again, **Prepare ideas and vocabulary here, NOT grammar or linking**</font>

| Method   | How it is?                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Practice | you just need to practice.                                   |
| Record   | recording yourself because you can write down what you said, you can analysis it. |
| Improve  | you can try to improve, you can check whether you use good vocabulary. Because one thing is to prepare good vocabulary but it's no good unless you actually use it, so you need to practice using the good vocabulary that you prepared. |

For example,

| Your favorite book                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| what is your favorite book?                                  |
| when did you first read it?                                  |
| where did you find this book?                                |
